## Setup in Codespaces

Simple technical analysis utilities for me setup in codespaces.

This project contains three parts.

1. Common plotting utilities containing yfinance and darts
2. Voila interactive dashboards for my ipython notebooks
3. Datapane reports to track accuracy automatically generated (low priority TBD)

### Setup

```bash
./install.sh
```

```
/home/codespace/.conda/envs/myenv/bin/python3
```
